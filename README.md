As part of a data science class (under a time constraint) we performed a detailed exploration of the famous [fake job postings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction), and developed a model to predict fake jobs with an 80% success rate. Find our presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Bgh6NoGb8X525AzKDaVscoGqg_0jcWNsdK02Mn392xE/edit?usp=sharing), and a brief article [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_agvTDZtStuiiDBrCJB0hRa003exjnlqfQE5jq2HGc/edit?usp=sharing). Our [modeling-notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ryTdgHX5d7zaFwDnZ4N_iccuVpzxV4QH?usp=sharing) with detailed walkthrough is available in this repo. We hope you enjoy it, and feel free to build upon our work for your own fun projects!
